    "# If Statement and Syntax Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python if statement is the main statement used for selecting from alternative actions based on test results.  Because this is our first in-depth look at compound statements -- statements that embed other statements --  we will also look at general concepts behind the Python syntax model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Python has a simple, statement-based syntax. However there are a few properties that you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statements execute one after the other, until you say otherwise**: Python runs code from the top of the file to the bottom, but note that if statements, for example, can cause the interpreter to jump around in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code boundaries are detected automatically**: Python uses the indentation of statements under a header to group the statements in a nested block. Also, the end of a line usually marks the end of the statement coded on that line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compound statements = header + : + indented statements**: See if statements section for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blank lines, spaces and comments are usually ignored**: Blank lines are ignored in files. Spaces inside of statements and expressions are almost always ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement is a compound statement that selects actions to perform.  Like all compound Python statements, the if statement may contain other statements, including other ifs. Python lets you combine statements in a program sequentially (so that they execute one after the other) and in an arbitrarily nested fashion (so that they execute only under certain conditions). Here is the general format :\n",
    "\n",
    "if *test1*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *statement1*\n",
    "    \n",
    "elif *test2*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *statement2*\n",
    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *statement3*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When the if statement runs, Python executes the first statement assoiciated with the first test that evalates to true, or the else block if all tests are false.  You can only have one if and else statement, but are allowed arbitrarily many elif tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, both the elif and else parts may be omitted, and there may be more than one statement nested in each section.  Note that words if, elif, else are associated by the fact that they line up vertically, with the same indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets write our first if statement...\n",
    "    "
